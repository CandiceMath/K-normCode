## Description

The goal of this software is to solve high-dimensional sparse linear regression problems 
under either the VaR or the CVaR risk measures. Please see the paper for details.

The software is written in MATLAB and compares with the publically available Gurobi optimizer
(https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-software/), and the PSG program 
(http://www.aorda.com/index.php/downloading/).  For all of them,
free academic licenses are available.

This software contains three kinds of optimization problems and the corresponding solvers:
- CVaR regression with a fixed lambda: the convex CVaR-based sparse linear regression with a fixed value of lambda.
  - **N-ALM**: the semismooth Newton based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian method
  - **ADMM**: the alternating direction method of multipliers 
  - **Gurobi**: the barrier method in Gurobi
  - **S-IRPN**: the smoothing method based on the inexact regularized proximal Newton method 
  - **PSG solvers**: seven solvers incuding **VAN**, **TANK**, **CAR**, **BULDOZER**, **VANGRB**, **CARGRB** and **HELI** in the PSG package  
- CVaR regression with a sequence of lambda: the convex CVaR-based sparse linear regression with a given sequence of grid points lambda.
  - **AS+N-ALM**: the adaptive sieving strategy combined with **N-ALM**
  - **Warm+N-ALM**: the warm-strated **N-ALM**
  - **N-ALM**: the pure **N-ALM** 
- truncated CVaR regression: the nonconvex truncated CVaR-based sparse linear regression.
  - **MM+N-PPA**: the majorization-minimization algorithm combined with the semismooth Newton method based on the proximal point algorithm
  - **MM+Gurobi**: the majorization-minimization algorithm combined with the barrier method in Gurobi

Two kinds of data sets are used in this software:
- UCI data
- Random data

This software contains nine folders:
- `Test1_fixed_lambda`: test the performance of **N-ALM**, **ADMM**, **Gurobi**, **S-IRPN** and **PSG solvers** for CVaR regression with a fixed lambda.
- `Test2_Solution_path`: test the performance of **AS+N-ALM**, **Warm+N-ALM** and **N-ALM** for CVaR regression with a sequence of lambda.
- `Test3_truncated_CVaR_MM`: test the performance of **MM+N-PPA** and **MM+Gurobi** for truncated CVaR regression.
- `Test4_Risk-averse_model`: test the performance of the risk-sensitive and risk-neutral regression models.
- `genUCIdatafun`: convert the UCI data from LIBSVM format to MAT format.
- `mainfun`: all main functions for the above solvers.
- `mexfun`: two funtions in MEX format.
- `solver`: all the subfunctions called by the above main functions.
- `UCIdata`: all availiable data for the UCI data and the high-accurate objective values.
